## GitHub Desktop

Up to now, we have done all of our GitHub work at the command line. Fortunately, there is an easier way to push things to GitHub. Now you may be thinking, "if there's an easier way, why are you being cruel and making me use the command line instead?" Rest assured; there is a good answer! 

Any remote work, such as using the cluster (i.e. epigenerate) cannot work with GitHub Desktop. This means that further down the line if/when you begin doing more computationally and resource heavy work, you will **need** to rely on command-line GitHub commands. You will not have the nice option of using GitHub Desktop. However, now that you should be comfortable with the command line method of Git pushing, we're going to make your life easier.

GitHub Desktop is a software that can be downloaded on your personal laptop/computer that can help manage your GitHub repositories. It's both visually appealing and mouse-friendly! We're going to have to do some set up and clean up stuff here, so bear with me as we work through this.

First, we're going to install GitHub Desktop. There are some great instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (albiet specific to Windows) on how to install it, but we will run through it together. First, visit the download page for GitHub Desktop. You will notice a link towards the bottom that says "Download for macOS." Click it and download the software.

Double-click the GitHub Desktop setup file (it usually defaults to the "Downloads" folder if you did not specify otherwise). Go through the on-screen instructions, which include setting up the software and logging into your GitHub account on the app.

Reference materials include Dr. Ian Korf's [MCB 185 material](https://github.com/vhaghani26/Learning_Python/tree/master/MCB%20185%20(Korf%20Course)) and [Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-science?index=product&queryID=4d4d882866dc3e8628ed7728b4662847&position=1) course by IBM hosted on edX. More specific references can be found in the text.

## A Brief Note: Months of Mistakes

Before we begin this session, I'd like to note that although this is the *Python* Focus Group, there are many housekeeping things that we can or need to do to effectively program. When I began learing Python, I used very basic tools with little understanding of the tools I had at my disposable. I used `nano` for months (disgusting!) and did all of my directory setup incorrectly. This meant that when I finally realized my big error, it was a conglomeration of several smaller mistakes, forcing me to delete all my work and start my setup from scratch. My goal here is to make your learning experience better. I want you to be aware of the tools you can utilize as well as understanding how incrediblly helpful some of these tools are. Therefore, this session may not be the *most* interesting or *most* helpful with learning Python coding directly, but it is a necessary step to get to the point of efficient coding. Your setup is as instrumental as the code you will write one day.

## Text Editors

### Introduction to Text Editors

A text editor is a type of computer program/software application that allows you to edit code as plain text files. It acts similar to editing a Word document, but for code. Rather than using `nano`, which requires the use of the keyboard only, text editors allow you to navigate with your mouse, copy and paste easily, and move code around in a much more human friendly way. Therefore, it's time for us to stop using `nano`. 

### Choosing a Text Editor

All of the files you have been editing with `nano` up to this point could have been edited with a text editor, such as: Atom, BBEdit, Geany, Gedit, Jedit, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code, etc. So which programming/text editor should you use? It depends. According to Ian Korf, "Whatever is installed by default in your Linux distribution should be fine. I use Geany on Linux, BBEdit on Mac, and Notepad++ on Windows." As a Windows user myself, I'm a big fan of Notepad++. Since most (if not all) of you are Mac users, BBedit is a great option. 

### Installing Your Text Editor

As much as I'd love to provide more concrete instructions here, your text editor choice may be different. I will provide instructions for the use of BBEdit on Macs, but if you have chosen to take a different route, it will be up to you to install your text editor.

#### BBEdit

[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) is one of the leading text editors for MacOS. Although there is a paid version, the free version is sufficient for most (and probably all) of what you will need to do. First, you will need to go to your browser and search "BBEdit" and click on the first link. As of the day I am making this, the first link should be "BBEdit 14 - Bare Bones Software." Click on the link, and then navigate to the right hand side of the page where there is a "Free Download" button. Wait for the file to download, and then open the file. Once opened, you should get a screen that instructs you to drag the BBEdit icon into the Applications folder. Do so.

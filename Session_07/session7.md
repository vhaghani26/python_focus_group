Reference materials include Dr. Ian Korf's [MCB 185 material](https://github.com/vhaghani26/Learning_Python/tree/master/MCB%20185%20(Korf%20Course)) and [Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-science?index=product&queryID=4d4d882866dc3e8628ed7728b4662847&position=1) course by IBM hosted on edX. More specific references can be found in the text.

### Sequence Types (List, Tuples, Ranges)

### Mapping Types (Dictionaries)

### Set Types (Set, Frozenset)

### Boolean Types (Boolean)

A Boolean value can take two on two values: True or False.

### Binary Types (Bytes, Bytearray, Memoryview)

## Getting the Data Type

There may be times where it will be helpful to check your data type. This will usually be in response to some sort of type error. To do so, you can use the `type()` function. Let's make some variables containing different data types and determine the types:

```
# Create variables with different data types
type1 = "Hello World"
type2 = 3
type3 = 7.9
type4 = 1j
type5 = ["Dog", "Cat"]
type6 = ("Dog", "Cat")
type7 = range(5)
type8 = {"Name": "Viki", "Age": 23}
type9 = {"Peach", "Apple", "Strawberry"}
type10 = frozenset({"Peach", "Apple", "Strawberry"})
type11 = True
type12 = b"Hello"
type13 = bytearray(5)
type14 = memoryview(bytes(5))

# Check data types
print(type1, type(type1))
print(type2, type(type2))
print(type3, type(type3))
print(type4, type(type4))
print(type5, type(type5))
print(type6, type(type6))
print(type7, type(type7))
print(type8, type(type8))
print(type9, type(type9))
print(type10, type(type10))
print(type11, type(type11))
print(type12, type(type12))
print(type13, type(type13))
print(type14, type(type14))
```

Note that among the data types above, I've only personally had to use strings, integers, floats, lists, ranges, dictionaries, and Boolean types. Your experiences may differ, so not all of the displayed types above may be necessary, but it's helpful to be aware that they exist.

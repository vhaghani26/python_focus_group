# Python Focus Group

## Introduction
The purpose of forming this Python Focus Group is to teach students in LaSalle Lab how to code in Python. Reference materials include Dr. Ian Korf's [MCB 185 material](https://github.com/vhaghani26/Learning_Python/tree/master/MCB%20185%20(Korf%20Course)) and [Python Basics for Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/python-basics-for-data-science?index=product&queryID=4d4d882866dc3e8628ed7728b4662847&position=1) course by IBM hosted on edX. 

## Session_01
The focus of Session 1 is to set up software and accounts to use Python and to start carrying out basic commands and actions at the command line. Topics include: 
* Terminals
* Opening the Terminal
* Directories
* GitHub
* Files
* UNIX Cheat Sheet

## Session_02
The focus of Session 2 is to finish software set up and begin learning basic Python commands and create our first script. Topics include:
* Installing Python
* Verifying Python Installation
* Python at the Command Line
* Python Scripts

Note: Still need to add more for Session 2

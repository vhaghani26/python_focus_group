# Session 1: Getting Started

## Terminals
Modern bioinformatics primarily uses Unix or a Unix-based operating system. Navigating a command line requires you to know Unix commands. However, Unix language is used in a shell program, aka a terminal. Depending on a user's operating system (Windows, Mac OS, Linux), different steps must be taken to access a Unix-based terminal. Fortunately, both Mac OS and Linux use Unix-based terminals by default. Windows, on the other hand, requires a few extra steps. The native Windows command prompt (terminal) does not use the Unix language required by most software. This means that Windows users need to install a different terminal capable of using Unix. One of the most common terminals for download is the Linux distribution: Ubuntu. Use of Ubuntu requires enabling WSL1 or WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Detailed instructions can be found using a simple search, but these are instructions that I find helpful for the [download of Ubuntu](https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10) and [enabling WSL2](https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-2-windows-10/). 

## Opening the Terminal
### Mac OS
(1) Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal  
(2) In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal

### Linux
This may vary depending on the Linux distribution being used, but at its simplest, you can open the terminal by directly pressing ctrl+alt+T or searching it up by clicking the "Dash" icon, typing "terminal" in the search box, and opening the Terminal application.

### Windows
Open the start menu and type "Ubuntu." Open the application. Using Ubuntu, you will be prompted to create an "account" involving a username and password. The password is required at times for installing or updating software, so it is important to keep note of your password.

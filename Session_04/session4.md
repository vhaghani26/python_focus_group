## Text Editors

### Introduction to Text Editors

A text editor is a type of computer program/software application that allows you to edit code as plain text files. It acts similar to editing a Word document, but for code. Rather than using `nano`, which requires the use of the keyboard only, text editors allow you to navigate with your mouse, copy and paste easily, and move code around in a much more human friendly way. Therefore, it's time for us to stop using `nano`. 

### Choosing a Text Editor

All of the files you have been editing with `nano` up to this point could have been edited with a text editor, such as: Atom, BBEdit, Geany, Gedit, Jedit, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code, etc. So which programming/text editor should you use? It depends. According to Ian Korf, "Whatever is installed by default in your Linux distribution should be fine. I use Geany on Linux, BBEdit on Mac, and Notepad++ on Windows." As a Windows user myself, I'm a big fan of Notepad++. Since most (if not all) of you are Mac users, BBedit is a great option. 

### Installing Your Text Editor

As much as I'd love to provide more concrete instructions here, your text editor choice may be different. For the purposes of this tutorial, I am going to run through setting up BBEdit. I'd like to quickly note that I am not at all familiar with the use of BBEdit and Mac-based text editors. I will try my best to give you straightforward instructions, but I am relying heavily on external resources for guidance. 

If you have chosen to proceed with a different text editor, please carry out the installation and set up on your own at this time. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask and we can explore or troubleshoot together.

#### Setting Up BBEdit

[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html) is one of the leading text editors for MacOS. Although there is a paid version, the free version is sufficient for most (and probably all) of what you will need to do. First, you will need to go to your browser and search "BBEdit" and click on the first link. As of the day I am making this, the first link should be "BBEdit 14 - Bare Bones Software." Click on the link, and then navigate to the right hand side of the page where there is a "Free Download" button. Wait for the file to download, and then open the file. Once opened, you should get a screen that instructs you to drag the BBEdit icon into the Applications folder. Do so. 

Once you have downloaded BBedit, you can create or open files. [Here](https://itservices.usc.edu/files/2013/11/bbedit.pdf) are some instructions from USC on the use of BBedit. Essentially, you will navigate to the "File" menu to carry out most of these tasks.
